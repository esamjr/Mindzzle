They are not only casual, informal wear, but serve as formal business attire in Hawaii.", "A sleeveless shirt is a shirt manufactured without sleeves, or whose sleeves have been cut off. Sleeveless shirts are worn by people of either gender, depending on the style. They are used as undershirts, or worn by athletes in sports such as track and field and triathlon.", "Sneakers are shoes primarily designed for sports or other forms of physical exercise, but which are now also widely used for everyday wear.", "A watch is a timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet."]
